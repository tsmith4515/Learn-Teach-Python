# Why I Wrote This
I've spent 3 months committing myself to learning Python in late 2016.  I went from Python ground zero to successfully solving Kyu 4/5 Python problems on CodeWars, able to land Python-related positions, being admitted to two data science bootcamps, and successfully freelance on Python with businesses in my spare time, as well as do "light" data-science for app-makers.

I started with not understanding that variables did not have to be declared in Python, and not understanding exactly what a "for loop" or "while loop" was.  Trust me, I have been there.  

Computer programming is made out to be extremely complex and "deep" in nature, but it is not so.  
* Does it require an analytical approach? Yes, but so does engineering and math. 
* Does it require that you learn specific rules of the language? Yes, but so does learning Spanish, French, or Mandarin.  
* Does it require focus and commitment?  Heck yes.

I was not able to learn in 3 months because I am exceptionally intelligent, or an "accelerated learner", have some "secret life hack", or any of those things.  

I intended to write this guide to show others the process and approach that got me here, so you can do it faster and better than me.  And you can teach your friends, colleagues, siblings, kids, and anyone who says it's too hard.

You too, CAN learn to code.  That is why I wrote this: to show that it is not impossible, and it is not a 3 year process.

# My Learning Philosophy
Process. Discipline. Systematic.

Those are the three words that encompass my learning (and teaching style).  It is in that order as well.  Process gives an anchor to stick to, discipline makes sure you stick to your anchor, and systematic continuously improves that process.

Now, for an example of how I applied it.

### CodeWars.

This is borrowed from a blog I read online.  I modified to my learning style.  CodeWars is a beautiful website that gives you real problems to test your coding chops, and it runs your written code through a series of tests to make sure it will work in various scenarios (QA Testing, in a nutshell).
Perhaps the coolest thing about CodeWars is that it will let you view the top rated answers for the specific problem you are solving.  You only get points (for leveling up) if you solve before you view the answers, of course.

My process was as follows: 

1. Spend a maximum of 45 minutes on the problem.  Solve it or not, go to the answers.  Don't spin your wheels.
2. I would then look at several of the top rated answers.  I researched their approach, tested it, understood, and tried to break it.
3. Classify the new approaches that I learned in Step (2) into the "Python toolbelt".  I regularly added concepts and examples to my Evernote account, where I kept track of the Python skills I learned.  Examples may be list comprehension, sorted, " ".join(), split, zip, or various other useful techniques.
4. **IMPORTANT.** Once you do the above 3, the fourth is key.  Take a few hours or a day away from the problem you just did, ***and go back to it*** with fresh eyes.  Do not refer to your notes, and try and solve it again, using the best method you found in the answers.  This will hammer it home and expand your Python toolbelt extremely quickly.

### Recap.

Now to clarify, how did I use process, discipline, and systematic in each of those?
* *Process.* The process was very procedural, steps 1-4, with a specified approach.
* *Discipline.* Discipline means not looking at the easily explained solution when you want to. It means testing it and figuring out how the function really works, and what its limitations are.  Discipline means waiting the 10 hours or day before redoing the problem to make sure you did indeed forget the solution, forcing you to relearn it.
* *Systematic.* I didn't always have the same process above. I didn't always try to "break" the most upvoted solution, and I didn't always reconstruct it.  At the beginning, I would just read the source docs on it, and try to use it in that problem.  Being systematic means committing to always improving your process and discipline.  It is a servant of the process.

P.S. more Python tips/hacks to come in this file, like my suggested approach with LPTHW and Project Euler, as well as my Evernote Python toolbelt template!  Stay tuned.

# About Me
I'm just a normal guy who likes to learn lots of new things and take on projects.  I do have a bit of ADD when it comes to picking and sticking to projects, but I use that to my benefit - it keeps life fun and light (though it is hard to focus at times).  Former lives have included tennis instructor, college chemistry TA, chemical engineer, business executive, entrepreneur, blogger, and world traveler.

Nowadays, I keep myself busy with constant learning (of course), focused now on a few things: (1) the psychology and art of people (Dale Carnegie), (2) tutoring various students/professionals in Python, Excel, and MS Access (anything data really), (3) I am partnering with [Code2College](http://www.code2college.org/) to memorialize these lessons into a High School Python course. This will be fantastic when it is done,and I am very excited! (4) my keen interest in art and building, right now it is my porch garden, woodworking, and music/song-writing, and (5) some career-related work and freelancing with my business and operations skillsets.  

My real passion is the intersection of people and technology, and ideally art.  I have yet to settle into that niche perfectly, but on the way!

I love my life, and I love meeting new people.

# Shout-Outs
Finally, this would not be complete without some shout-outs.  To my friends: Jeremy, Nick, Chris, Carl, and Kevin, that went along the Python journey with me at various points, giving me advice and encouragement as I went.  

And for the online resources that got me going: <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">Python for Google Developers class</a>, <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/dashboard">CodeWars</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, as well as several other miscellaneous resources online that helped me set the direction of my learning and given me real problems to work on.

It is always best to learn in pairs, because you get a new perspective, AND you make a closer friend along the way.  Learn Python with a friend!

# Tutoring
I am taking new students that are open to the process and guidelines of my teaching philosophy above.  If you and friends are interested, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:tsmith4515@gmail.com) with your information and learning objectives.  Please include the words "Python Tutor" in your email subject, as I receive a large volume of emails.
